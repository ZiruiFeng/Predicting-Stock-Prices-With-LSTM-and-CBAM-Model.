# Predicting Stock Prices Using LSTM-CNN-CBAM Model

# DS-UA 301 Final ProjectKaggle
Members: Zirui(Frank) Feng, Zongjian(James) Li

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a prediction model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict stock price movements based on data from Kaggle NYSE dataset. We compare performance of LSTM in differnt attentions: ECA, SE, HW and CBAM to demonstrate which LSTM combination is so far one of the best approaches to predict stock prices.
